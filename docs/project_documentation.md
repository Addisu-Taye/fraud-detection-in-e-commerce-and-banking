## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Missing value handling
   - Timestamp conversion
   - IP-to-country mapping
   - Feature engineering

2. **Modeling**
   - Train-test split
   - Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   - Evaluation using F1-score, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR

3. **Explainability**
   - SHAP-based interpretation of model predictions
   - Summary and force plots for global and local insights

---

## 📋 Best Practices Followed

- Modular code structure
- Proper documentation
- Model explainability
- Handling class imbalance
- Version control using Git

---

## 📦 Deployment Notes
